## Base Functionality for Vert.x Applications

This project provides common functionality for writing Vert.x applications in
accordance with our internally defined best practices. It attempts to isolate
the application developer from keeping up with the latest library versions,
security updates, etc. and provides a toolkit for how to use Vert.x in a safe
manner.
